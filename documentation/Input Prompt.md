Develop a **Vessel Call Management** module within a **Port Community System (PCS)** using a **monolithic architecture** with **Java (Spring Boot) for the backend** and **Angular for the frontend**.

This module should manage the entire vessel arrival, berthing, and departure process, integrating with port authorities, shipping lines, and service providers.

----------

### **Key Features & Functionalities:**

#### **1. Pre-Arrival Notifications**

- Implement an API for ships to submit **electronic pre-arrival reports**.

- The report should include:

  - **Vessel details** (IMO number, name, flag, type).

  - **Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)**.

  - **Cargo manifest** (type, quantity, hazardous materials if applicable).

  - **Crew list** (captain, crew members, nationality).

- Validate reports based on **port regulations** and store them in a database.

#### **2. Berth Allocation & Scheduling**

- Develop a **berthing schedule system** that assigns berths based on:

  - **Vessel size & type**.

  - **Cargo category** (containers, bulk, liquid, RoRo).

  - **Real-time berth availability**.

- Implement **conflict resolution algorithms** to handle berth scheduling conflicts.

- Allow **port authorities** to approve/reject berth requests via a web UI.

#### **3. Mooring & Tug Services Coordination**

- Create a **digital booking system** for mooring and tug services.

- Allow vessel operators to **request and modify bookings** for mooring/tugboats.

- Integrate **real-time availability tracking** of tugboats & mooring teams.

- Provide **notifications & alerts** for confirmed service bookings.

#### **4. Port Clearance & Departure Approval**

- Automate port clearance workflow, ensuring compliance with maritime regulations.

- Implement **digital checklists** for clearance:

  - Customs & immigration approvals.

  - Cargo security verification.

  - Port dues & tariff payments validation.

- Reduce vessel waiting time by enabling **real-time clearance status updates**.

- Generate **departure approval certificates** once all clearance steps are completed.

----------

### **Technology Stack & Architecture:**

- **Backend:** Java (Spring Boot), RESTful APIs, PostgreSQL/MySQL

- **Frontend:** Angular, TypeScript

- **Messaging & Notifications:** WebSockets, Kafka/RabbitMQ (for real-time updates)

- **Security:** OAuth2, JWT-based authentication

- **Integrations:** APIs for customs, maritime authorities, and logistics services

----------

### **Expected Deliverables:**

1. **Database schema** for vessel call management (ships, berths, schedules, services).

2. **REST API endpoints** for pre-arrival submissions, berth allocation, service bookings, and clearance approvals.

3. **Frontend UI (Angular)** for port authorities to manage vessel calls, berths, and services.

4. **Notification system** to alert stakeholders on status updates.

5. **Role-based access control (RBAC)** for port operators, vessel agents, and service providers.

----------

### **Additional Considerations:**

- Should support **multi-port operations** for ports under the same authority.

- Must ensure **real-time synchronization** of berth allocation data.

- Implement **audit logging** to track modifications in scheduling and approvals.
